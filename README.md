# Rock Paper Scissors
(The Odin Project – Foundations Course: JavaScript)

This project is an introductory exercise created as part of the **JavaScript section of The Odin Project Foundations Course**.

Its purpose is to practice core JavaScript concepts such as variables and functions.  
Throughout this project, I aim to reinforce my understanding of basic JavaScript logic while building a simple playable Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
